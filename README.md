# Implementation-and-Performance-Evaluation-of-CMOS-Inverter-using-Cadence-Virtuoso
Designed and simulated a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso with GPDK90 technology, covering schematic, symbol creation, and layout design. Performed DC, transient, and parametric analyses to evaluate performance metrics such as noise margins, propagation delay, and power consumption.
